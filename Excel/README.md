## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to understand the factors contributing to road accidents and their impact on casualties. By examining the data, we aim to identify patterns and trends, which can help authorities and policymakers devise targeted road safety measures to reduce accidents and minimize casualties.


### We want to have insight into the below KPIs-
* Primary KPI - Total Casualties taken place after the accident.
* Primary KPIs â€” Total Casualties & percentage concerning accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
* Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type.
* Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year.
* Maximum casualties by Road Type.
* Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface.
* Relation between Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/ Night.

### Steps taken:
* Understanding the Business Case.
* Data Cleaning. Removed duplicate and wrongly spelled names were corrected. 
* Data Processing. Added a few columns based on the data, for example, Months and years.
* Data Analysis using pivot tables.
* Data Visualization using charts.
* Creation of a dynamic and interactive dashboard.
